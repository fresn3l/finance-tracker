Spending analysis module for financial transactions.

This module provides comprehensive analysis of spending patterns, including:
    - Monthly summaries with income/expense breakdowns
    - Category-level spending analysis
    - Spending trends and patterns
    - Top categories identification
    - Average spending calculations

The analyzer works with lists of Transaction objects and provides various
aggregation and analysis methods.

Example:
    >>> from finance_tracker.analyzer import SpendingAnalyzer
    >>> 
    >>> analyzer = SpendingAnalyzer(transactions)
    >>> 
    >>> # Get monthly summary
    >>> summary = analyzer.get_monthly_summary(2024, 1)
    >>> print(f"Income: ${summary.total_income}")
    >>> print(f"Expenses: ${summary.total_expenses}")
    >>> print(f"Savings Rate: {summary.savings_rate:.1f}%")
    >>> 
    >>> # Get category breakdown
    >>> breakdown = analyzer.get_category_breakdown()
    >>> for category, amount in breakdown.items():
    ...     print(f"{category}: ${amount}")
    >>> 
    >>> # Get top spending categories
    >>> top = analyzer.get_top_categories(limit=5)
    >>> for pattern in top:
    ...     print(f"{pattern.category}: ${pattern.total_amount}")

        MONTHLY SUMMARY CALCULATION:
        ============================
        
        This method aggregates all transactions for a given month and calculates:
        
        1. **Total Income**: Sum of all income transactions
        2. **Total Expenses**: Sum of all expense transactions
        3. **Net Amount**: Income - Expenses (positive = savings, negative = deficit)
        4. **Category Breakdown**: Spending by category
        5. **Transaction Count**: Number of transactions in the month
        
        HOW IT WORKS:
        =============
        
        Step 1: Filter transactions for the month
        - Use list comprehension to filter by year and month
        - This is efficient and readable
        
        Step 2: Initialize accumulators
        - total_income: Starts at 0
        - total_expenses: Starts at 0
        - category_breakdown: Dictionary to track spending by category
        
        Step 3: Process each transaction
        - If income: Add to total_income
        - If expense: Add to total_expenses and category breakdown
        
        Step 4: Calculate net amount
        - Simple subtraction: income - expenses
        
        Step 5: Create summary object
        - MonthlySummary contains all calculated values
        
        WHY DEFAULTDICT?
        ================
        
        `defaultdict(Decimal)` automatically creates Decimal("0") for new keys.
        This makes it easy to accumulate category totals:
        
        ```python
        category_breakdown["Groceries"] += amount  # Works even if "Groceries" doesn't exist yet
        ```
        
        Without defaultdict, you'd need:
        ```python
        if "Groceries" not in category_breakdown:
            category_breakdown["Groceries"] = Decimal("0")
        category_breakdown["Groceries"] += amount
        ```

        Args:
            year: Year to analyze (e.g., 2024)
            month: Month to analyze (1-12, where 1=January, 12=December)

        Returns:
            MonthlySummary object containing:
            - Total income for the month
            - Total expenses for the month
            - Net amount (income - expenses)
            - Transaction count
            - Category breakdown (spending by category)
            
        Example:
            >>> analyzer = SpendingAnalyzer(transactions)
            >>> summary = analyzer.get_monthly_summary(2024, 1)
            >>> print(f"Income: ${summary.total_income}")
            >>> print(f"Expenses: ${summary.total_expenses}")
            >>> print(f"Net: ${summary.net_amount}")
